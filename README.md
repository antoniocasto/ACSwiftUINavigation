# Purpose of This Repository

This repository is a **personal reinterpretation** of the navigation architecture demonstrated in Felipe Espinoza’s **MovieCatalog** project.  
The goal is to explore and adapt a modular **SwiftUI navigation system for iOS 17+**, capable of handling **push, sheets, full-screen presentations, deep links, and universal links** within a unified structure.  

By centralizing navigation through a `Router` and `Destination` approach, this project aims to reduce coupling between views, improve extensibility, and serve as a foundation for scalable SwiftUI applications.

## Inspiration

- **Author**: Felipe Espinoza  
- **GitHub**: [fespinoza/Youtube-SampleProjects](https://github.com/fespinoza/Youtube-SampleProjects/tree/movie-catalog-routing/00-routing-and-deep-links/MovieCatalog)  
- **YouTube Video**: [Crafting Swift – Navigation in SwiftUI](https://www.youtube.com/@craftingswift)  

This repository does not intend to be a direct copy, but rather a **personal adaptation** of Espinoza’s ideas to fit a custom modular architecture approach.
